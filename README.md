# iris-flower-classification
Using Machine Learning, I trained a Logistic Regression model on the Iris flower dataset. The model can predict the species of a flower based on its input features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
# Iris Flower Classification - Machine Learning Project

This project uses the classic **Iris flower dataset** to build a simple **machine learning model** using **Logistic Regression** for multi-class classification. Implemented in Python using popular ML libraries.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Dataset
The dataset consists of 150 records of iris flowers, with features:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

Target classes:
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

## How it works
1. Load and preprocess the dataset
2. Visualize with pair plots
3. Train a Logistic Regression model
4. Evaluate with accuracy & classification report
5. Accept custom input from the user and predict species in real-time

## Sample Output

Enter sepal length: 5.1
Enter sepal width: 3.5
Enter petal length: 1.4
Enter petal width: 0.2
Predicted Iris Class is => setosa
